# License

Using this code assumes you have agreed to this.

This code is free for you to use in your projects, but you are required to give credit to me if you use it at all. You must include a link to my website and a link to this repo.

**Example:** The kinematic controller in this project used [Gamepro5](https://gamepro5.com)'s [Custom Kinematic Physics Controller](https://github.com/Gamepro5/Custom_Kinematic_Physics).

You are not allowed to take this code and sell it as-is, meaning you can't just copy this code and try to sell it to others. You can only sell software that uses this code if it is included in a project that contains at least 1000 lines of code that does not include comments. This is to prevent people from trying to find loopholes and essentially re-selling my hard work.
