# Custom_Kinematic_Physics
A custom attempt at solving the infamous Godot slope bug I've been dealing with for months. Be sure to deploy with visible collision shapes!

This project took me an extremely long time to perfect, so please read the [license](/LICENSE.md) if you want to use it.

Missing Features:
* Walking up and down stairs, only moving up smooth slopes are supported
* Swimming and Ladders though that should not be hard to implement.

Please contribute to this project using the pull request system if you manage to fix a bug or add a feature!
